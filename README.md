# Horiseonfinal
## In this project we were tasked with cloaning a starter code, refactoring the code to meet the criteria, and meeting the grading requirements

##Instalation
In order to complete this project git bash, VS code, and github required. 
First it was necassary to clone the project from the repository provided
	The Steps to complete this were as follows
	1. copy the ssh address from the starter code
	2. clone the repository in git bash
	3. push the repository from git bash
Next we needed to make edits in VS code. This was completed by using the module one presentations for refrence and refactoring the code
After each change made a push was made from git bash to git hub
After we pushed from git bash the page was created from within git hub

##Usage
The usage for this project is to correct the refactor the code on a already working web page (horiseon)
The goal was to make the code easier to read
